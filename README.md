# Terraria Source Code


Started because me and a friend wanted to research a specfic check in the game. Now I just commit the decompiled source code from dotPeek so other people can fuck around wit the source code.

I am not responsible for any legal consequences that may happen. This is only to be used as a reference and nothing else. This is a passion project of mine and none of the code was made by me. I only want to make certain versions of the source code available for everyone.
